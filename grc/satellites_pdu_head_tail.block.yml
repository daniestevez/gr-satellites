documentation: |-
    Slices some bytes from the beginning or end of a PDU
    This works in the same manner that the head -c and tail -c UNIX commands,
    with the difference that the Tail+ mode numbers the bytes of the PDU starting
    by 0, while the UNIX command numbers them starting by 1.

    Output:
        A PDU containing a slice of the bytes from the input PDU

    Parameters:
        Mode: the mode, which is:
              - Head  to work as head -c num
              - Head- to work as head -c -num
              - Tail  to work as tail -c num
              - Tail+ to work as tail -c +num (except for the numbering of the bytes)
        Num: the number of bytes, as the num parameter of head or tail
