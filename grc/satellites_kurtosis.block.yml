documentation: |-
    This block computes an unbiased estimate of the Kurtosis of a complex signal
    for each block of M input samples. The block supports vectors, in which case
    the Kurtosis is computed component-wise. This can be used to compute
    spectral Kurtosis, for instance.

    Input:
        A stream of IQ samples (or vectors of IQ samples)
    Output:
        The stream decimated by the Block Size, with each output sample containing
        the estimated Kurtosis of each block of input samples.

    Parameters:
        Block Size: Size of the block for the Kurtosis estimate
        Vector Length: Vector length
