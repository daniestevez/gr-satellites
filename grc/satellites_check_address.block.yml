documentation: |-
    Enter an address (choose "from" for source or "to" for destination callsign) and/or enter a digipeater callsign.
    The address callsign may have a SSID, the digipeater callsign must not have a SSID.
    
    Example and results:
    Address: PCSAT-1 (from)
    Digicallsign: W3ADO

    Every frame with PCSAT-1 as source callsign will be forwarded to output port "ok".
    Every frame with "via" W3ADO (SSID is arbitrary) and hbit set (usually marked with an asterisk (*) to show that it was digipeated) will be forwarded to output port "ok".
    Everything else will be forwarded to output port "fail".
