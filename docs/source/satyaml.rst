SatYAML files
=============

SatYAML files are used by gr-satellites to describe the properties of each
specific satellite, such as what kind of protocols and telemetry formats it
uses. They are `YAML`_ files and are based around the concept of
components. Using SatYAML files, the ``gr_satellites`` command line tool and the
Satellite decoder block can figure out which components to put together to
decode a particular satellite.


SatYAML files are stored in the ``python/satyaml`` directory. Below we show the
SatYAML file ``1KUNS-PF.yml`` to give an overall idea of the format of these
files.

.. code-block:: yaml

       data:

       - *image

First we can see some fields that give basic information about the
satellite. The ``name`` field indicates the main name of the satellite, which is
used by ``gr_satellites`` and the Satellite decoder block when calling up the
satellite by name. There is an optional list of ``alternative_names`` which can
also be used to call up the satellite by name. The ``norad`` field gives the
NORAD ID of the satellite and it is used when calling up the satellite by
NORAD ID.

Additional telemetry servers used for this satellite can be specified with the
``telemetry_servers`` field (see ``python/satyaml/PW-Sat2.yml`` for an example).

The ``data`` section indicates the different kinds of data transmissions that
the satellite makes, and gives the decoders for them. The following can be used:

* ``telemetry``, which specifies a telemetry decoder giving out the telemetry
  definition (see :ref:`Telemetry parser`)

* ``file`` or ``image``, which specify a file receiver or image receiver giving
  out the ``FileReceiver`` or ``ImageReceiver`` class (see :ref:`File and Image receivers`)

* ``decoder``, which specifies a custom decoder from
  ``satellites.components.datasinks``. This is used for more complex decoders
  not covered by the above.

* ``unknown``, which specifies that the data format is not known, so hex dump
  should be used to show the data to the user

The ``transmitters`` section lists the different transmitters used by the
satellite, their properties, and ties them to the entries in the
``data`` section according as to which data is sent by each of the transmitters.
A transmitter is understood as a specific combination of a frequency,
modulation and coding.

Each transmitter has a name (such as ``1k2 FSK downlink``) which is currently
used only for documentation purposes, a ``frequency``, which gives the downlink
frequency in Hz (currently used only for documentation), a ``modulation``, that
specifies the demodulator component to use, a ``baudrate``, in symbols per
second, a ``framing``, that specifies the deframer to use, and a list of
``data`` that has entries referring to the items in the ``data`` section.

The modulations allowed in the ``modulation`` field are the following:

* ``AFSK``, for which the :ref:`AFSK demodulator` is used

* ``FSK``, for which the :ref:`FSK demodulator` with Subaudio set to ``False``
  is used

* ``FSK subaudio``, for which the :ref:`FSK demodulator` with Subaudio set to
  ``True`` is used

* ``BPSK``. Coherent BPSK, for which the :ref:`BPSK demodulator` with
  Differential and Manchester set to ``False`` is used

* ``BPSK Manchester``. Coherent Manchester-encoded BPSK, for which the
  :ref:`BPSK demodulator` with Differential set to ``False`` and Manchester set
  to ``True`` is used

* ``DBPSK``. Differentially-encoded BPSK, for which the :ref:`BPSK demodulator`
  with Differential set to ``True`` and Manchester set to ``False`` is used to
  perform non-coherent demodulation

* ``DBPSK Manchester``. Differentially-encoded and Manchester-encoded BPSK, for
  which the :ref:`BPSK demodulator` with Differential and Manchester set to
  ``True`` is used to perform non-coherent demodulation

The ``AFSK`` modulation also needs the ``deviation`` and ``af_carrier`` fields
that indicate the AFSK tone frequencies in Hz, as in the AFSK demodulator. Optionally,
it is possible to indicate the deviation of the FM modulation using the ``fm_deviation``
field. By default, an FM deviation of 3 kHz is assumed.

The framings allowed in the ``framing`` field are the following:

* ``AX.25``, `AX.25`_ with no scrambling (see :ref:`AX.25 deframer`)

* ``AX.25 G3RUH``, `AX.25`_ with G3RUH scrambling (see :ref:`AX.25 deframer`)

* ``CCSDS Concatenated``, CCSDS Concatenated TM codewords (see :ref:`CCSDS deframers`)

  scrambler and a (255,223) Reed-Solomon code for the payload

* ``Astrocast FX.25 NRZ-I``, custom framing used by Astrocast 0.1. This is a
  somewhat non compliant `FX.25`_ variant.

* ``Astrocast FX.25 NRZ``, custom framing used by Astrocast 0.1. This is a
  somewhat non compliant `FX.25`_ variant that is identical to the FX.25 NRZ-I
  mode except that NRZ is used instead of NRZ-I.

* ``AO-40 uncoded``, uncoded AO-40 beacon. It uses 512 byte frames and a CRC-16

* ``TT-64``, custom framing used by QB50 AT03, which uses a Reed-Solomon (64,48)
  code and CRC16-ARC

  transceiver with a PN9 scrambler and a CRC-16

  as the ``Reaktor Hello World`` framing, but uses a different syncword.

* ``MRC-100 RA``, Repeat-Accumulate FEC as used by SMOG-1. The difference with
  ``SMOG-P RA`` is a 32-bit syncword, a smaller frame size, and the inclusion of

* ``SMOG-P Signalling``, custom signalling frames as used by SMOG-P and ATL-1

* ``SMOG-1 Signalling``, custom signalling frames as used by SMOG-1. The difference
  with ``SMOG-P Signalling`` is the addition of a different PRBS to mark transitions

  with a PN9 scrambler and CRC-16.

  an 1N8 UART-like encoding with MSB-bit-ordering,
  and HDLC ``0x7e`` flags to mark the frame boundaries.

* ``YUSAT``, custom framing used by YUSAT-1. It is like AX.25 but without
  bit stuffing, LSB byte endianness, and NRZ-I.

* ``AX5043``, FEC framing used by the AX5043 transceiver IC. This uses a convolutional
  code, a 4x4 interleaver, and HDLC framing with the CRC16-USB.

* ``USP``, the `Unified SPUTNIX Protocol`_, which is based on CCSDS concatenate frames
  with custom synchronization and a PLS based on DVB-S2.

* ``DIY-1``, the custom framing used by DIY-1, which uses an RFM22 chip transceiver.

* ``GEOSCAN``, the custom framing used by GEOSCAN-EDELVEIS.

* ``SPINO``, the custom framing used by the SPINO payload on INSPIRE-Sat7.

* ``QUBIK``, the custom framing used by QUBIK.

* ``Hades``, the custom framing used by HADES-D.

Some framings, such as the CCSDS protocols need the additional field
``frame size`` to indicate the frame size.

The CCSDS framings need several additional fields to specify the details of the
CCSDS protocol. These are:

* ``precoding: differential`` should be used to specify differential
  precoding. It if is not specified, differential precoding will
  not used.

* ``RS basis:`` should have the value ``conventional`` or ``dual`` to specify the
  Reed-Solomon basis. This field is mandatory.

* ``RS interleaving:`` should be used to specify interleaved Reed-Solomon
  codewords. It defaults to 1 (i.e., no interleaving) if not specified.

* ``scrambler:`` should have the value ``CCSDS`` or ``none``. This field is
  optional and defaults to ``CCSDS`` if not specified.

* ``convolutional:`` should have one of the following values: ``CCSDS``,
  ``NASA-DSN``, ``CCSDS uninverted``, ``NASA-DSN uninverted``.  This field is
  optional and defaults to ``CCSDS`` if not specified.


The ``AX100 ASM+Golay`` mode also supports the ``scrambler`` field, with the
possible values ``CCSDS`` and ``none``. The default is ``CCSDS``, but the value
``none`` can be used in case the scrambler needs to be disabled (which is a
rarely used feature).

The following example shows how transports are indicated in SatYAML files.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: KS-1Q
   norad: 41845
   data:
     &tlm Telemetry:
       telemetry: csp
   transports:
     &kiss KISS:
       protocol: KISS KS-1Q
       data:
       - *tlm
   transmitters:
     20k FSK downlink:
       frequency: 436.500e+6
       modulation: FSK
       baudrate: 20000
       framing: CCSDS Concatenated dual
       frame size: 223
       transports:
      - *kiss

Instead of specifying a ``data`` entry in the transmitter, a ``transports``
entry is used instead. Transports are defined in a section above. They have a
name, used for documentation purposes, a ``protocol``, and a list of ``data``
entries to tie them with the appropriate data decoders.

The allowable transport protocols are the following:

* ``KISS``, KISS protocol with a control byte (see :ref:`KISS transport`)

* ``KISS no control byte``, KISS protocol with no control byte (see
  :ref:`KISS transport`)

* ``KISS KS-1Q``, KISS variant used by KS-1Q, which includes a header before the
  KISS bytes

* ``TM KISS``, TM frames containing a KISS stream in some virtual channels

* ``TM short KISS``, short (5 byte) TM frames containing a KISS stream in some
  virtual channels
